| Layer | Purpose | Storage | Runtime |
|-------|---------|---------|---------|
| **Book Writer Service** | Autonomous chapter-by-chapter book generation | SQLite (`book_writer_progress` table) | Server-side only |
| **Book Writer Plugin** | Client-side book state for Writing Studio | `localStorage` | Browser only |
| **Writing Studio** | Interactive document editor with AI actions | `localStorage` + brand workspace | Client + streaming API |
| **De-AI-ify** | Post-processing filter that removes AI patterns | Stateless | Either side |
| **Editor Review** | Tracked-changes review with accept/reject | Per-request | Server-side |

---

## 2. Book Writer Service (Autonomous)

**File:** `src/lib/agent/book-writer.ts`
**API Route:** `src/app/api/book-writer/route.ts`
**UI:** `src/app/book-writer/page.tsx`

The Book Writer Service is a singleton that writes a book one chapter at a time. It is designed to run autonomously — the heartbeat agent (see `/bookwriter` command) can trigger it every 2 hours to scan repo changes and write/update chapters.

### Book Metadata

| 20 | Appendix: Complete Prompt Library | 2,500–3,500 |

Chapters 1-8 have hand-crafted detailed prompts with analogies, required sections, and specific word counts. Chapters 9-20 use a generic prompt builder with topic-specific guidance.

### Writing Pipeline

```
writeChapter(n)
  ├─ Set chapter status → "writing"
  ├─ Generate content via chatCompletion (system prompt + chapter prompt)
  │   ├─ System prompt: getGlobalBookInstructions() — writing rules, style, structure
  │   └─ User prompt: chapter-specific prompt (analogies, sections, word count)
  ├─ If deaiifyEnabled:
  │   ├─ deaiify(content, mode) → revised text + human score
  │   └─ Log: original score → revised score, change counts
  ├─ Set chapter content, status → "completed", humanScore
  ├─ Update totalWords across all chapters
  ├─ Advance currentChapter or mark book "completed"
  └─ Save to SQLite
```

### Global Book Instructions

The system prompt enforces:
- Target audience: complete beginners, no prior coding knowledge
- Human writing style: contractions, direct language, varied sentence length
- No AI clichés ("harness the power", "game-changer", "In today's fast-paced world")
- No formal transitions ("Moreover", "Furthermore", "Additionally")
- Every technical term defined on first use (bold + analogy + why it matters)
- Mandatory chapter structure: opening → "What You'll Learn" → explanations → step-by-step → "Try It Yourself" (3+ boxes) → "Personalize" → "Common Pitfalls" → Summary
- Every chapter ends with: "You now hold real enterprise-grade AI power in your hands..."

### De-AI-ification Modes

The book writer defaults to `preserve-formal` mode. Three modes are available:

| Mode | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| `strict` | All 47 patterns applied. Removes all formal transitions. |
| `preserve-formal` | Keeps some formal transitions, removes obvious hedging only. **Default.** |
| `academic` | Preserves academic transitions (Moreover, Furthermore, etc.). |

### Storage

Progress is stored in SQLite via `sqlDatabase.getSetting('book_progress')` / `setSetting(...)`. The SQLite schema includes a `book_writer_progress` table (see `src/lib/database/sqlite.ts:925`).

### Node.js Variant

`src/lib/agent/book-writer-node.ts` is a file-system-based variant that stores progress in `data/book_progress.json` instead of SQLite. It also reads `data/PROJECT_OVERVIEW_BOOK_PROMPT.md` as the project context file. This variant uses `glm-4.7-flash` and includes `sanitizePrompt` on all user-facing text. The SQLite version (`book-writer.ts`) is the active one used by the API route.

---

## 3. Book Writer Plugin (Client-Side)

**File:** `src/plugins/book-writer/index.ts`

A separate singleton that runs in the browser and stores progress in `localStorage`. This is the version used by Writing Studio's Book Panel.

### Key Differences from Server Service

| Aspect | Server Service | Client Plugin |
|--------|----------------|---------------|
| Storage | SQLite | localStorage |
| Model | `glm-4-flash` | `ollama/qwen3.5:9b` (default) |
| De-AI-ify | Yes (integrated) | No |
| Chapters | 20 (beginner guide) | 21 (on-premise focus) |
| Content generation | Direct `chatCompletion` | `/api/chat` endpoint |
| Regenerate | Not supported | Supported (`regenerateChapter`) |
| Manual edit | Not supported | Supported (`updateChapterContent`) |

### Plugin Chapter Outline (21 chapters)

```

---

## 4. Writing Studio (Interactive Editor)

**File:** `src/app/writing-studio/page.tsx`
**Route:** `/writing-studio` (also `/writing` redirects here)

Writing Studio is a full-featured writing environment with a rich-text editor, AI actions, book panel, research chat, outline generator, templates, version history, and chapter navigation.

### Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **ManuscriptEditor** | Rich-text contenteditable editor with title, font settings, dark/light theme |
| **AI Actions Toolbar** | 9 one-click AI transformations on selected text |
| **Book Panel** | Side panel showing book chapters; click to load chapter content into editor |
| **Outline Generator** | Generate hierarchical outlines from a topic (essay, blog, article, report, general) |
| **Research Chat** | Web-search-enabled chat panel for research while writing |
| **Brand Voice** | Select a brand workspace to apply brand voice to AI-generated content |
| **Templates** | Pre-built document templates (blog, proposal, etc.) |
| **Version History** | Auto-saves versions every 5 minutes, keeps last 20 |
| **Chapter Navigation** | Extracts H1/H2/H3 headings from content for quick navigation |
| **Mermaid Diagrams** | Generate Mermaid.js diagrams from selected text, rendered inline |
| **Tables** | Generate markdown tables from selected text, converted to HTML |
| **Linguix Grammar** | External grammar check via Linguix API |
| **Model Selector** | Uses global model context for AI actions |

### AI Actions

| Action | Icon | What It Does |
|--------|------|-------------|
| Expand | 📄 | Make text 2-3x longer with more detail and examples |
| Outline | 📋 | Create hierarchical markdown outline from content/topic |
| Rewrite | 🔄 | Rewrite in a specified style |
| Simplify | 💡 | Simplify complex text for general audience |
| Humanize | ✨ | Add perplexity and burstiness to sound more human |
| Grammar | ✓ | Fix grammar, spelling, and logical flow |
| Linguix | 📝 | External grammar check via Linguix API |
| Diagram | 📊 | Generate Mermaid.js flowchart from selected text |
| Table | 📱 | Generate markdown table from selected text |

### Streaming Pipeline

AI actions use Server-Sent Events (SSE) streaming via `/api/writing/stream`:

```
Client selects text → clicks AI action
  → POST /api/writing/stream { action, text, brandId, model }
  → Server builds prompt, calls streamChatCompletion
  → SSE chunks: data: { "content": "..." }\n\n
  → Client accumulates chunks, shows real-time text in editor
  → On done: convert markdown → HTML, replace selection
  → Sync content back to React state
```

For Ollama models, true streaming is used (chunk-by-chunk). For external APIs (OpenRouter, GLM, DeepSeek) that return complete responses, the server simulates streaming by sending the content in 20-character chunks.

### Persistence

| What | Where | When |
|------|-------|------|
| Document content + title | `localStorage('writing_studio_doc')` | On every content/title change |
| Settings (font, size, save dir) | `localStorage('writing_studio_settings')` | On settings change |
| Version history (last 20) | `localStorage('writing_studio_versions')` | Every 5 minutes |
| Book progress | `localStorage('book_progress')` (plugin) | On chapter write |

Content is also saved on `visibilitychange` (tab hidden) and `beforeunload` (page close).

---

## 5. De-AI-ification Filter

**File:** `src/lib/writing/de-ai-ify.ts`

A deterministic text transformation that removes AI-generated patterns and restores natural human voice. Based on analysis of 1,000+ AI vs human content pieces.

### 47 Detection Patterns (5 categories)

| Category | Count | Examples |
|----------|-------|---------|
| Overused transitions | 11 | "Moreover," "Furthermore," "In conclusion," "In today's landscape" |
| AI clichés | 18 | "harness the power," "unlock potential," "game-changer," "cutting-edge" |
| Hedging language | 13 | "It's important to note," "One might argue," "Importantly," |
| Corporate buzzwords | 22 | "utilize"→"use", "leverage"→"use", "facilitate"→"help", "optimize"→"improve" |
| Vague quantifiers | 9 | "various"→remove, "numerous"→"many", "plethora of"→"many", "arguably"→remove |

### Scoring System (0-10)

The `calculateHumanScore()` function evaluates text on 8 dimensions:

| Factor | Penalty/Bonus | Threshold |
|--------|---------------|-----------|
| AI patterns per 1000 words | -1 to -3 | >5, >10, >20 patterns |
| Sentence length variance (CV) | -0.5 to -1.5 | CV < 0.3, < 0.2 (too uniform = AI) |
| Average sentence length | -0.5 to -1 | > 25, > 30 words |
| Hedging phrase count | -0.5 to -1.5 | > 1, > 3 occurrences |
| Passive voice indicators | -0.5 to -1 | > 2, > 5 matches |
| Contraction ratio | -0.5 to +0.5 | < 0.5 (too few), > 2 (natural) |
| Specific numbers/data | +0.5 | > 3 occurrences |
| First person usage | +0.3 | > 3 occurrences |

Score labels:

| Score | Label |
|-------|-------|
| 9-10 | Human-like |
| 8-9 | Natural voice |
| 7-8 | Good, minor refinements needed |
| 6-7 | Mixed - could be human or AI |
| 4-6 | AI-heavy - needs work |
| 2-4 | Obviously AI-generated |
| 0-2 | Robotic |

### Transformation Pipeline

```
deaiify(text, mode, options)
  ├─ Calculate original score
  ├─ Select patterns based on mode (strict/preserve-formal/academic)
  ├─ Apply regex replacements (transitions, clichés, hedging, buzzwords, vague quantifiers)
  ├─ fixRoboticPatterns():
  │   ├─ Replace 3rd+ "However" with "But"
  │   ├─ Fix excessive "While X, Y" openings
  │   ├─ Fix rhetorical question → answer patterns
  │   └─ Fix "Here are the top N ways" prefacing
  ├─ addNaturalVoice():
  │   ├─ Add contractions ("it is"→"it's", 30+ patterns)
  │   ├─ Convert passive → active voice (10 patterns)
  │   └─ Shorten sentences > 40 words at natural break points
  ├─ Clean up whitespace, capitalize sentence starts
  ├─ Calculate revised score
  ├─ identifyFlagsForReview() — flags remaining issues for manual review
  └─ Return DeAiResult { originalText, revisedText, originalScore, revisedScore, changes, flagsForReview }
```

### ChangeLog Output

```typescript
interface ChangeLog {
  transitionsRemoved: number;
  clichesRemoved: number;
  hedgingRemoved: number;
  buzzwordsReplaced: number;
  roboticPatternsFixed: number;
  examplesAdded: number;
  sentencesShortened: number;
  contractionsAdded: number;
  activeVoiceUsed: number;
}
```

### Flags for Review

After transformation, the filter flags remaining issues:
- Still uses "various" — suggests specific examples
- Still uses "numerous" — suggests specific count
- Unqualified claims ("significantly improved") — add data
- Vague references ("many companies") — use specific names
- Abrupt transitions between sentences with no word overlap

### Usage

```typescript
import { deaiify, analyzeText, formatDeAiResult, DeAiMode } from '@/lib/writing/de-ai-ify';

// Full transformation
const result = deaiify(text, 'preserve-formal');
console.log(result.revisedText);
console.log(result.revisedScore);  // 0-10
console.log(result.changes.transitionsRemoved);

// Quick analysis (no transformation)
const analysis = analyzeText(text);
console.log(analysis.score, analysis.issues, analysis.suggestions);

// Format for display
const formatted = formatDeAiResult(result);  // Markdown report
```

---

## 6. Editor Review (Tracked Changes)

**File:** `src/app/api/editor-review/route.ts`

A server-side endpoint that produces tracked-changes review of text, with AI-generated reasons for each change. Integrates with the book writer — if no text is provided, it can pull the next unwritten chapter from the book writer service.

### ReviewChange Structure

```typescript
interface ReviewChange {
  id: string;
  type: 'insert' | 'delete' | 'format';
  status: 'pending' | 'accepted' | 'rejected';
  author: 'ai' | 'user';
  authorColor: string;  // Purple for AI, blue for user, etc.
  position: number;
  positionEnd: number;
  originalText: string;
  newText: string;
  timestamp: number;
  reason: string;  // AI-generated 1-sentence explanation
}
```

### Pipeline

```
POST /api/editor-review { text, action, brandVoice, documentType }
  ├─ If no text: pull next chapter from bookWriterService
  ├─ Generate revised version via chatCompletion
  ├─ Diff original vs revised
  ├─ For each change: ask AI to explain in one sentence (max 15 words)
  ├─ Return changes array with positions, texts, and reasons
  └─ Client renders accept/reject UI
```

### Reviewer Colors

| Role | Color |
|------|-------|
| AI | `#9333ea` (purple) |
| User | `#3b82f6` (blue) |
| Reviewer 1 | `#10b981` (green) |
| Reviewer 2 | `#f59e0b` (amber) |
| Reviewer 3 | `#ef4444` (red) |

---

## 7. Writing API Endpoints

### `/api/writing` (non-streaming)

**File:** `src/app/api/writing/route.ts`

Handles 25+ writing actions. Returns complete JSON response.

#### Actions

| Category | Actions |
|----------|---------|
| **Core writing** | expand, outline, continue, rewrite, simplify, elaborate, structure |
| **Quality** | grammar, humanize, review, track_changes |
| **Business** | proposal, sbir, capture_plan, deadline_finder, evaluation_factors, compliance_matrix, proposal_outline, past_performance, risk_identification |
| **Content** | blog_post, social_media, ad_copy, product_description, email_template |
| **Visual** | diagram (Mermaid.js) |
| **Advanced** | delegate (uses model bus for hierarchical model selection) |

#### Request Format

```json
{
  "action": "expand",
  "text": "Text to transform",
  "style": "professional",
  "model": "ollama/llama3.2:latest",
  "stream": false,
  "brandId": "optional-brand-uuid",
  "projectId": "optional-project-uuid"
}
```

#### Special Actions

- **track_changes**: Returns JSON array of changes with original/edited/reason. Client applies accepted changes to produce improved text.
- **review**: Returns 3-10 specific suggestions with location, issue, suggestion, and reason.
- **delegate**: Uses the model bus to escalate writing tasks to better models when needed (cloud-smart tier preferred).
- **diagram**: Returns Mermaid.js code block for rendering as SVG.

#### Context Injection

All actions can receive:
1. **Memory context** — from `memoryFileService.getSystemPrompt()` (max 800 chars)
2. **Brand context** — from `brandWorkspace.buildContextForChat(brandId, projectId)` (max 2000 chars)

These are prepended to the system message.

---

### `/api/writing/stream` (SSE streaming)

**File:** `src/app/api/writing/stream/route.ts`

Same writing actions but with Server-Sent Events streaming. Used by Writing Studio for real-time text generation.

#### Supported Actions

expand, outline, continue, rewrite, simplify, elaborate, structure, humanize, grammar

(Defaults to expand for unknown actions.)

#### SSE Format

```
data: {"content":"chunk of text"}\n\n
data: {"content":"more text"}\n\n
data: [DONE]\n\n
```

#### Streaming Behavior

- **Ollama**: True token-by-token streaming via `streamChatCompletion`
- **External APIs** (OpenRouter, GLM, DeepSeek): Complete response is chunked into 20-char segments and sent as SSE for simulated streaming

---

### `/api/book-writer`

**File:** `src/app/api/book-writer/route.ts`

| Method | Action | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| GET | — | Get progress, canContinue, nextChapter |
| POST | `init` | Initialize new book, reset progress |
| POST | `writeNext` | Write the next pending chapter |
| POST | `writeChapter` | Write a specific chapter by number |
| POST | `fullBook` | Get complete book as Markdown string |

---

### `/api/editor-review`

**File:** `src/app/api/editor-review/route.ts`

POST with `{ text, action, brandVoice, documentType }` → returns tracked changes array. If no text provided, uses book writer to get next chapter.

---

### `/api/writing/export`

**File:** `src/app/api/writing/export/route.ts`

POST with `{ content, title, format }`:

| Format | Output |
|--------|--------|
| `docx` | Word document via `docx` library, with H1/H2/H3 heading levels |
| `pdf` | Text-based PDF (simple, not pdfkit) |

---

## 8. Export Pipeline

### Markdown Export (Book Writer)

Both the server service and client plugin have `getFullBook()` which assembles all chapters into a single Markdown string:

```markdown
# Book Title

## Subtitle

*By Author*

---

**Dedication:** ...

**Credits:** ...

---

Description text.

*GovBotics note*

---

## Chapter 1: Title

Chapter content...

---

## Chapter 2: Title

...
```

The `/book-writer` UI page has an "Export Document (Markdown)" button that triggers a client-side Blob download.

### DOCX Export

The `/api/writing/export` endpoint uses the `docx` npm library to create properly formatted Word documents with:
- Title (centered, HeadingLevel.TITLE)
- H1 → HeadingLevel.HEADING_1
- H2 → HeadingLevel.HEADING_2
- H3 → HeadingLevel.HEADING_3
- Body text → 12pt TextRun

---

### Run the book writer via API

```bash
# Initialize
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/book-writer \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"action":"init"}'

# Write next chapter
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/book-writer \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"action":"writeNext"}'

# Get full book
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/book-writer \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"action":"fullBook"}'

# Check progress
curl http://localhost:3000/api/book-writer
```

### Apply de-AI-ification to any text

```typescript
import { deaiify } from '@/lib/writing/de-ai-ify';

const result = deaiify(aiGeneratedText, 'preserve-formal');
console.log(`Score: ${result.originalScore.toFixed(1)} → ${result.revisedScore.toFixed(1)}`);
console.log(`Changes:`, result.changes);
console.log(result.revisedText);
```
